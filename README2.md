# Brickblock Smart Contracts
These are all of the smart contracts which power the Brickblock ecosystem.

## Installing
1. Install dependencies using:

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

1. Install [mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril), a security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts

    ```sh
    # You will need python3 and pip3 for this to work
    pip3 install mythril
    ```

## Testing
Main tests can be run using:
```sh
yarn test
```

Stress test can be run using:
```sh
yarn test:stress-tests
```

Frozen contracts (`BrickblockToken` & `CustomPOAToken`) can be tested using:
```sh
yarn test:frozen
```

## Security Analysis
Mythril can be run in order to check for vulnerabilities:
```sh
yarn test:mythril
```

## Linting
Linting both js and sol files can be done using:
```
yarn lint
```

`.sol` only:
```
yarn lint:sol
```

`.js` only:
```
yarn lint:js
```

## Deployment
Mainnet deployment is done through offline signing of transactions. But testnet deployments can be done through truffle.

TODO: add instructions for deployment to testnet once migration file is done!

## General Overview

The ecosystem is powered by 12 different contracts. 1 additional contract is a standalone contract which is meant to be an early stage proof of concept which does not rely on the rest of the ecosystem.

Ecosystem Contracts:
1. BrickblockToken
1. AccessToken
1.
